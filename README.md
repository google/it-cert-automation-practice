# Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate - Practice files

I will try things out on this fork.
E.g. I'll fix some missing logic in Course3/Lab4/validations.py, which misses the rule that the first char should be alphabetic.
E.g. one more line for testing purpose

This repository contains the practice files used throughout the courses that are
part of the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate

There's a separate folder for each course.
